//! Implementation of syscalls
//!
//! The single entry point to all system calls, [`syscall()`], is called
//! whenever userspace wishes to perform a system call using the `ecall`
//! instruction. In this case, the processor raises an 'Environment call from
//! U-mode' exception, which is handled as one of the cases in
//! [`crate::trap::trap_handler`].
//!
//! For clarity, each single syscall is implemented as its own function, named
//! `sys_` then the name of the syscall. You can find functions like this in
//! submodules, and you should also implement syscalls this way.
